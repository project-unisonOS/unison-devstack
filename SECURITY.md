# Security

This repository contains the Docker Compose configuration and scripts for running the UnisonOS devstack.

Devstack is intended for local development on trusted hardware. For overall security guidance and production deployment considerations, see:

- https://project-unisonos.github.io/reference/security/

Do not expose devstack directly to the public internet. If you discover a security issue in the devstack configuration, please follow the responsible disclosure guidance in the UnisonOS security docs or open a private security advisory on GitHub.
